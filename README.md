# Hi 👋, I'm Thilan Dissanayaka.

I’m currently working at WSO2 as a Security Engineer. An engineering graduate with deep expertise in software engineering and a strong foundation in computer science, I specialize in cybersecurity with hands-on experience in penetration testing, malware analysis, exploit development, and reverse engineering. I have a proven track record of securing web applications and APIs, analyzing low-level vulnerabilities, and implementing robust defense mechanisms.

In simple words,
I ❤️ Computer science.
